      <description>Tiny Renderer Implementation Github Link
Information Written in C++. feature includes: performance measuring / debug menu, immediate mode GUI. About my own (futile) attempt of implementing software rasterizer, a product of following tiny-renderer course.
implemented in about 2 months span, initially began to purely follow the material of the course.
just like I did in rust toy language, I eventually started to deviate from the oiriginal chapter, and started implementing features in my own way.</description>
