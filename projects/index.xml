About C99 port of Yarn Spinner&amp;rsquo;s Runtime, a tool for writing game dialogue.
written for integrating into my own game development.
this project is not associated with the owner/developer of Yarn Spinner.
Feature API contained in a single header, which makes it easy to integrate. (although currently depends on protobuf, which is unavoidable.) reads a set of yarnc + CSV files. register C functions into Yarn Spinner easily, done in a way similar to Lua.</description></item><item><title>Ring Buffer</title><link>https://komugi1211s.github.io/projects/ring-buffer-game/</link><pubDate>Tue, 12 Apr 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://komugi1211s.github.io/projects/ring-buffer-game/</guid><description>Ring Buffer Github Link Itch.Io Link
